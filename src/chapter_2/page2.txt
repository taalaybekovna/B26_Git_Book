[EXTRA] How to remove folder that accidentally tracked
and pushed to GitHub
Example: If you have accidentally pushed your .idea folder with many files in it, here is the
steps to untrack it.
- Go to IntelliJ terminal in bottom menu
- Type this command : git rm -r --cached .idea and hit enter
- if it is a file you may omit -r so it will be git rm --cached fileName
- This will remove .idea folder from local git repo and will not track it from this
point on.
- Make a commit and select all un-versioned files from commit window and
commit
- Push it back to remote and observe it's been removed from remote repo as well
